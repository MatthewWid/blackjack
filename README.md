#Blackjack
Blackjack is a game I've always enjoyed remaking in different languages and in different ways, it embraces many different elements of a language that are required to make this sort of game.

In this version, I am going to be using JS, and modifying the DOM, to create this game. This could possibly be one of my biggest projects yet, and I am working on it for an assignment at school.

#Blackjack
Blackjack is a game I've always enjoyed remaking in different languages and in different ways, it embraces many different elements of a language that are required to make this sort of game.

This is a web based version that is going to be a step up from my previous attempts at creating the game.

If you turn betting on in *init.js* you can see the pretty visuals, although there is no betting system, and probably will not be.

**Please report any bugs you find in the "issues" section!**

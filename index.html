					BlackJack is a game of the player versus the dealer.<br /><br />At the start of the round the dealer places one card up. The player is dealt a hand of two cards. The player has two options, <b>Hit</b> or <b>Stand</b>.<br /><b>Hit</b>ting is when the player requests another card (card values range from 1-11). <b>Stand</b>ing is when you end your turn and submit your hand.<br /><br />The aim of the game is to get ones hand value as close to 21 without exceeding 21, this is acomplished by hitting and then standing when you are happy with your hand, going over 21 is called a bust and your hand is discarded and your turn is ended.<br /><br />Once you choose to stand, it is the dealers turn, the dealer will keep drawing cards until their handle value goes over 17 or they bust (go over 21).<br />To win, the dealer must bust or you must have a higher hand value than the dealer once he has stopped drawing.
